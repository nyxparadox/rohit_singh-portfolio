    <!-- ================= PROJECT 1 ================= -->
    <section class="project-detail">
      <h2>Smart Doorbell System</h2>
      <span class="project-tagline">
        IoT-based Visitor Monitoring & Notification System
      </span>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional doorbells provide no context or history of visitors.
        This project addresses that limitation by enabling real-time visitor
        monitoring and cloud-based logging through a mobile application.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Built</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and implemented an end-to-end IoT system that captures
        visitor images using an ESP32-CAM, securely stores them in the cloud,
        logs events in a database, and delivers real-time notifications to
        a Flutter-based mobile application.
      </p>

      <h3>System Workflow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Visitor presses the doorbell</li>
        <li>ESP32-CAM captures an image</li>
        <li>Image is uploaded to Cloudinary</li>
        <li>Event is logged in Firebase Firestore</li>
        <li>Python service triggers FCM notifications</li>
        <li>Flutter app displays visitor details</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time push notifications</li>
        <li>Cloud-backed visitor history</li>
        <li>Cross-platform Flutter mobile app</li>
        <li>Secure authentication and encrypted communication</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
      <p class="tech-stack">
        ESP32-CAM • Arduino • Firebase Firestore • Firebase Cloud Messaging •
        Cloudinary • Python • Flutter
      </p>

      <h3>What This Project Demonstrates</h3>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates my ability to design complete IoT systems,
        integrate embedded hardware with cloud services, and build secure,
        real-time mobile applications.

    <!-- ================= PROJECT 2 ================= -->
    <section class="project-detail">
      <h2>Chat Application</h2>
      <span class="project-tagline">
        Real-Time Messaging Application
      </span>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Reliable real-time communication requires proper authentication,
        synchronization, and cloud integration. This project focuses on
        implementing a clean and efficient real-time chat experience.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Built</h3>
      <p>
        I developed a real-time chat application using Flutter and Firebase
        that allows authenticated users to exchange messages instantly with
        synchronized updates across devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time message delivery</li>
        <li>Firebase-based authentication</li>
        <li>Responsive and simple chat interface</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Design Decision</h3>
      <p>
        Media sharing features such as image and video transfer were
        intentionally excluded to keep the system lightweight and focused
        on real-time communication fundamentals.
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
      <p class="tech-stack">
        Flutter • Dart • Firebase Firestore • Firebase Authentication
      </p>

      <h3>What This Project Demonstrates</h3>
      <p>
        This project highlights my understanding of real-time systems,
        authentication workflows, and scalable mobile app development.
      </p>

    <!-- ================= PROJECT 3 ================= -->
    <section class="project-detail highlight-project">
      <h2>MelodySync <small>(In Progress)</small></h2>
      <span class="project-tagline">
        Voice-Activated Music Synchronization System
      </span>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Existing music recognition systems can identify songs but cannot
        synchronize playback with a user’s singing. MelodySync explores
        a new way of interacting with music through vocal input.
      </p>

      <h3>What I’m Building</h3>
      <p>
        MelodySync is an AI-based system that listens to a short segment of
        a user singing, identifies the song, determines the exact timestamp
        in the original track, and resumes playback from that precise position.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wake word activates the system</li>
        <li>Short vocal sample is recorded</li>
        <li>Pitch contours and melodic patterns are extracted</li>
        <li>Patterns are matched against a song database</li>
        <li>Playback resumes from the detected timestamp</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What Makes It Different</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional systems that rely on lyrics or audio fingerprinting,
        MelodySync focuses on melodic structure, allowing recognition from
        humming or singing alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Current Status</h3>
      <p>
        The current implementation runs in a terminal environment, prioritizing
        accuracy, synchronization precision, and low latency. UI and streaming
        integrations are planned for future versions.
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Domains</h3>
      <p class="tech-stack">
        Python • Digital Signal Processing • Music Information Retrieval •
        Time-Series Analysis
      </p>

      <h3>What This Project Demonstrates</h3>
      <p>
        MelodySync demonstrates my ability to work with complex signal-processing
        concepts, design algorithm-driven systems, and explore innovative
        human–computer interaction models.
